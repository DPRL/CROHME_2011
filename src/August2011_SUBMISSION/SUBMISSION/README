1. INTRODUCTION.

This folder contains, in addition to a compiled version of the system
entry point, a script for running a single input file through the system.


2. FILE AND FOLDER DESCRIPTIONS.

	- Release
		Compiled executable that is the main entry point for running files on
		the system. Note that this CAN be called directly but a preferable
		method is to use the scripts provided.
	
	- README
		This file.
	
	- runsys.sh
		The script for running a single input file through the system. Further
		information on using this file can be found in following section(s).

		
3. SCRIPT USAGE.

This script was designed to be easy to use and provide a high level of control
over system parameters.

3a. SCRIPT PARAMETERS.

The script takes two parameters; they are both required:

	$ ./runsys.batch.sh INPUTFILE OUTPUTFILE
	
	- INPUTFILE is the name of the input file to be run.
	
	- OUTPUTFILE is the name of the file to which the results should be saved.

3b. SYSTEM PARAMETERS.

System parameters can be set with the variables at the top of the script (above
the "do not edit" warning):

	- GRAMMARFILE is the name of the grammar file. Assumed to be in the
	  Release/ directory.
	
	- STATSFILE is the name of the (layout/adjacency) statistics file. Assumed
	  to be in the Release/ directory.
	
	- PROCTIMEOUT is the timeout to set for a single thread. Any file for which
	  system execution time exceeds this value will be aborted and reported as
	  such.
	
	- TOPN is the value for the maximum number of classification possibilities
	  to consider. Note that the system's run time increases greatly with
	  higher values.
	
	- PROBTHRESHOLD is the value at which to prune classification results
	  (i.e. potential classifications with a probability less than this value
	  will be immediately discarded). Set this to 0 for no pruning.

3c. RUNNING THE SCRIPT AND UNDERSTANDING OUTPUT.

Invoke the script as shown above (under "3a. SCRIPT PARAMETERS").

The system will be invoked and the result will be saved to the output file.

Note that by default the system's output streams are not redirected and it
will produce output at the end that may or may not be useful. If this
information is to be captured, the script invoker will need to redirect
output manually.
