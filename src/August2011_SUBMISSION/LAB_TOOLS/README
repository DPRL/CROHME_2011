1. INTRODUCTION.

This folder contains, in addition to a compiled version of the system
entry point, a script for running multiple input files in batch.


2. FILE AND FOLDER DESCRIPTIONS.

	- Release
		Compiled executable that is the main entry point for running files on
		the system. Note that this CAN be called directly but a preferable
		method is to use the scripts provided.
	
	- README
		This file.
	
	- runsys.batch.sh
		The script for running multiple input files in batch. Further
		information on using this file can be found in following section(s).

		
3. SCRIPT USAGE.

This script was designed to be easy to use and provide a high level of control
over system parameters.

3a. SCRIPT PARAMETERS.

The script takes two parameters: the first is required, the second optional:

	$ ./runsys.batch.sh INPUTFILELIST [OUTPUTDIRECTORY]
	
	- INPUTFILELIST is a plain-text file that has the names of input files,
	  one file per line. It is suggested that the input files be moved to this
	  directory (i.e. the same directory as the script) and then just the raw
	  file names listed in this file, without any path prefix.
	
	- OUTPUTDIRECTORY is the path to the desired output directory. All output
	  from the run will be put here. If it is not provided, a folder in the
	  current directory will be created; the name will be a time/datestamp.
	  Either way, the script will report the output directory for reference.

3b. SYSTEM PARAMETERS.

System parameters can be set with the variables at the top of the script (above
the "do not edit" warning):

	- GRAMMARFILE is the name of the grammar file. Assumed to be in the
	  Release/ directory.
	
	- STATSFILE is the name of the (layout/adjacency) statistics file. Assumed
	  to be in the Release/ directory.
	
	- PROCTIMEOUT is the timeout to set for a single thread. Any file for which
	  system execution time exceeds this value will be aborted and reported as
	  such.
	
	- TOPN is the value for the maximum number of classification possibilities
	  to consider. Note that the system's run time increases greatly with
	  higher values.
	
	- PROBTHRESHOLD is the value at which to prune classification results
	  (i.e. potential classifications with a probability less than this value
	  will be immediately discarded). Set this to 0 for no pruning.
	
	- RUNATONCE is the number of files to run at once (i.e. number of files
	  in one "batch"). Note that the system tends to perform poorly if this
	  value is too high; recommended values are RUNATONCE <= ~50. Reduce this
	  value if batches are not completing due to memory issues.
	  
	- THREADS is the number of threads to utilize when running a single batch.
	  If RUNATONCE is sufficiently small, this number will optimally equal
	  RUNATONCE. It is suggested that THREADS not exceed 10, though this may
	  vary depending on the specifications of the machine running the system.

3c. RUNNING THE SCRIPT AND UNDERSTANDING OUTPUT.

Invoke the script as shown above (under "3a. SCRIPT PARAMETERS").

In the output directory, a folder will be created for each batch, named with
the batch number (e.g. "1", "2", etc.). In each batch folder will be the list
of files in that batch (".currentrunlist") as well as the output inkml files
when they are produced. Additionally, stdout and stderr of the classification
executable are redirected to "classify.out" and "classify.err", respectively.
